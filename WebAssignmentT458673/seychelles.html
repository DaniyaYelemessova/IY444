      <h2>Visiting the Okavango Delta in Botswana was an unforgettable experience and my childhood dreamüåç</h2>
      <p> I have always been fascinated by its incredible landscapes, rich wildlife, and unique culture. My interest grew even more after reading The No. 1 Ladies‚Äô Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith. The stories painted a vivid picture of life in Botswana, making me eager to experience it for myself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We saw almost too many zebra, giraffe, gnus, elephants, tsessebees, waterbuck, impala, red
        lechwe, kudu, baboons, reed buck, mongoose, various eagles, warthogs, jackals, buffalo, sable
        antelope. We were so lucky! It was also a perfect time to see the young. It was fascinating to learn
        their habits, about the food chain & to see how they interact with each other, such an insight into
        animal behaviour. This was nature as it happens.
