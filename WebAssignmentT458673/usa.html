          Visiting the Statue of Liberty is an amazing experience, but there are a few things I learned from my trip that can make your visit even better.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <!-- List of tips for visiting the Statue of Liberty -->
        <ul>
          <li>Prepare for Seasickness – If you get seasick easily, I highly recommend taking motion sickness pills before the ferry ride. The water can be rough, and without them, your experience might be uncomfortable - just like mine was the first time!</li>
          <li>If you don’t read about its history beforehand or take a guided tour, the visit might feel like just walking around and taking pictures.</li>
          <li>Wear Comfortable Shoes – You’ll be walking a lot, so comfortable shoes are a must! Plus, the lines for the ferry can be very long, and you might have to stand for a long time before boarding.</li>
        </ul>
