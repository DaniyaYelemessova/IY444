      <h2>Australia Through My Eyes: <span>A Wonderful Experience</span></h2>
      <p>One of the things that fascinated me the most was the opposite seasons. Coming from a place where Christmas meant cold weather and warm drinks, it felt surreal to celebrate it in +40°C heat, with people heading to the beach instead of heading to the city center to go ice skating. </p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Another fact that surprised me was how it's not recommended to drive between cities at night. The roads can be dangerous due to the increased risk of encountering kangaroos, especially when you consider that the kangaroo population in Australia is estimated to be over 50 million, while the human population is around 26 million!</p>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Another unforgettable experience was learning about snake safety. Before moving, I never thought I’d need a preparation course on what to do if I encountered a snake! It turns out that in Australia, it’s a normal part of life - especially in rural areas. I learned to always check my shoes before putting them on, avoid tall grass, and most importantly, stay calm if I ever came across one. Thankfully, I never had to put that knowledge to the test!</p>

      <p class="sydeny-harbor"><span>Circular Quay</span> was one of my favourite spots in Sydney. I used to start my mornings with a run along the harbour, enjoying the incredible views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. After my run, I loved grabbing breakfast at one of the cafés by the water, watching the ferries and taking in the energy of the place. If you ever visit Sydney, you have to experience the vibe and explore the amazing places around Circular Quay - it's a must!</p>
